# Browser Tab Switch Shortcuts

Convenient shortcuts to switch between browser tabs
* Alt + Shift + Left -> move left
* Alt + Shift + Right -> move right

Note that both commands will wrap around the list of tabs (treated as a circular list).

Tab groups are automatically uncollapsed / collapsed on enter / leave respectively.
